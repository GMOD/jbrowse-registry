## Registering a Plugin

We would love for you to register your plugin! It's really easy to do:

1. Edit the [`plugins.yaml`](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-registry/edit/master/plugins.yaml)
   file, and add your plugin to the end of the list
2. Submit the pull request to this repo

You're done! Once the administrator accepts the PR, the plugin will be published on the site.

## Building the Site

This step is for developers, and is not required for registering a plugin with the site.

```
make
```

## Deploying

```
make deploy
```
